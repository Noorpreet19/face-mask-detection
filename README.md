## Inspiration
Entering any public area is highly dangerous because of the spread of coronavirus and highly populated countries like in India requires a solution for it. So for this, here comes my proposed system! The  Face-Mask Detector + with audio output. 
The model we've built could be potentially used to ensure safety.
## What it does
It is a real-time face mask detection system, which detects if a person entering the premises is wearing a mask or not. If yes, it says, "Great! You have got your mask on! Kindly use sanitizer and enter the premises" and if you're not, "Kindly wear your mask!".
## How I built it
I built it with Pytho+ its libraries and trained with MobileNetV2

## What's next for Face Mask Detection + Audio Correction
People tend to wear their mask incorrectly hence if we add a part where the model detects incorrect placement of mask too by training with the appropriate dataset obtained from supermarkets and other places the model can be used effectively for further use too!
